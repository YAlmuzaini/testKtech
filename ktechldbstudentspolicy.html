                    HOW "RESPONDUS MONITOR" WILL BE USED. The use of Respondus
                    Monitor will require individual student activity to be
                    recorded, both audibly and visually, during certain
                    assessment sessions. Other data related to individual
                    student activity during assessment sessions may also be
                    recorded by Respondus Monitor, such as, for example, without
                    limitation, time taken by a student to answer specific
                    inquiries on an assessment. The recordings are controlled by
                    your Institution and will be processed by an agent of your
                    Institution, namely, Respondus, through its Respondus
                    Monitor Services. Respondus Monitor may analyze the
                    recordings through automated processes to generate
                    additional data derived from the recordings, with the
                    additional data being associated with individual students
                    for use by your Institution in evaluating the recordings.
                    This additional information includes the creation of a
                    temporary template of facial features during automated
                    processing, and such template is used by the server
                    executing the Respondus Monitor software to determine
                    whether the student who started the exam differs from the
                    person in the video frame throughout the duration of the
                    exam . The template is not saved to the cloud server's
                    database or storage and is cleared from the server's memory
                    by Respondus Monitor after the processing is complete. The
                    additional data, as well as the original recordings, may be
                    evaluated by agents of your Institution, including your
                    instructors, to review, assess, and analyze student
                    performance and conduct, among other things, for the purpose
                    of improving educational processes for students, including
                    investigating student conduct violations. Your Institution
                    works with Respondus to help ensure your privacy regarding
                    the recordings and to comply with applicable laws and
                    regulations as to any information or data (including any of
                    the video or audio recordings). See the sections below

                    or data that is available via Respondus Monitor, for any
                    reason, including a violation of any of these Terms.

                    the intellectual property rights of others whenever you
                    provide information or data on or through Respondus Monitor.
                    You also agree that your Institution is not responsible for
                    protecting any intellectual property rights you, or another

                    OPT-OUT. If you cease to agree with these Terms, or the
                    privacy and security policy below at some point in the
                    future, you may opt-out by contacting your Institution.
                    However, opting-out may affect how you will need to complete
                    your course, and your Institution makes no representations
                    regarding how it will affect your relevant course or any
                    ramifications from opt-out (e.g., you may not be able to
                    complete the requirements of such course). As such, we
                    encourage you to speak with your instructor before opting
                    out.

                    You will bear all risk associated with any information or

                    All legal issues arising from or related to the use of
                    Respondus Monitor between you and your Institution shall be
                    construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which
                    your Institution resides, or if your Institution resides in

                    Institution, or the state in which the branch of your
                    Institution resides with which you correspond. By using
                    Respondus Monitor and thus agreeing to these Terms, you
                    consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and
                    federal courts located in and serving the county in which
                    your Institution resides, or if your Institution resides in

                    Institution resides with which you correspond. Your
                    Institution may terminate your use of Respondus Monitor if
                    you violate these Terms, and will terminate your use if you
                    use Respondus Monitor to infringe on the intellectual
                    property rights of others. If your Institution should fail
                    to enforce any right or provision in these Terms, this
                    failure shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                    provision or of any other rights or provisions in these
                    Terms. If a court or trier of fact should find that one or
                    more rights or provisions set forth in these Terms are
                    invalid, you agree that the remainder of the right or
                    provisions shall be enforceable and that, to the extent
                    permitted by law, the court shall give effect to the
                    parties' intentions, as reflected in any such right or
                    provision that has been declared invalid or unenforceable.
                    If you do not agree to the Terms, you will not be permitted
                    to use Respondus Monitor. Any term that would naturally
                    survive termination of these Terms shall survive, such as,

                  The use of Respondus Monitor will require individual student
                  activity to be recorded, both audibly and visually, during
                  certain assessment sessions. Other data related to individual
                  student activity during assessment sessions may also be
                  recorded by Respondus Monitor, such as, for example, without
                  limitation, time taken by a student to answer specific
                  inquiries on an assessment. The recordings are controlled by
                  your Institution and will be processed by an agent of your
                  Institution, namely, Respondus, through its Respondus Monitor
                  Services. Respondus Monitor may analyze the recordings through
                  automated processes to generate additional data derived from
                  the recordings, with the additional data being associated with
                  individual students for use by your Institution in evaluating
                  the recordings. This additional information includes the
                  creation of a temporary template of facial identifiers during
                  automated processing, and such template is used in the
                  temporary memory of the server executing the Respondus Monitor
                  software to determine whether the student who started the exam
                  differs from the person currently in the video frame being
                  processed by the Respondus Monitor Service. The template is
                  not saved to the cloud server's database or storage and is
                  cleared from the server's memory by Respondus Monitor after
                  the processing is complete. The additional data, as well as
                  the original recordings, may be evaluated by agents of your
                  Institution, including your instructors, to review, assess,
                  and analyze student performance and conduct, among other
                  things, for the purpose of improving educational processes for
                  students, including investigating student conduct violations.
                  Your Institution works with Respondus to help ensure your
                  privacy regarding the recordings and to comply with applicable
                  laws and regulations as to any information or data (including
                  any of the video or audio recordings). Respondus personnel do
                  not review/analyze the recordings except as may be required to
                  resolve technical problems, improve system performance, modify
                  Respondus Monitor, investigate violations of these Terms, or
                  as may be directed by your Institution or applicable law
                  enforcement.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Each student that is recorded will have a unique username or
                  identification code ("ID") and password through your
                  Institution's (or its learning institution's) LMS or learning
                  system. The ID and password will be usable by students, at the
                  discretion of your Institution, to allow students to transmit
                  recordings and data to the online component of Respondus
                  Monitor if required by your Institution as part of an
                  assessment activity. Instructors, administrators and other
                  agents of your Institution, may access those recordings and
                  data related to their students through Respondus Monitor. You
                  must guard your password and not share it with anyone to help
                  ensure your security and privacy of your data.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Random samples of video and/or audio recordings may be
                  collected via Respondus Monitor and used by Respondus to
                  improve the Respondus Monitor capabilities for institutions
                  and students. The recordings may be shared with researchers
                  under contract with Respondus to assist in such research. The
                  researchers are consultants or contractors to Respondus and
                  are under written obligation to maintain the video and/or
                  audio recordings in confidence and under terms at least as
                  strict as these Terms. The written agreements with the
                  researchers also expressly limit their access and use of the
                  data to work being done for Respondus and the researchers do
                  not have the right to use the data for any other purposes. No
                  personally identifiable information for students is provided
                  with the video and/or audio recordings to researchers, such as
                  the student's name, course name, institution, grades, or
                  student identification photos submitted as part of the
                  Respondus Monitor exam session. Other than the purposes
                  identified above, Respondus will not share recordings or
                  personally identifying information of any particular student
                  (collectively, also referred to herein as "personal
                  information or data") with third parties (third parties do not
                  include the student who provided the personal information, the
                  parent/guardian of a student under the age of 18 who provided
                  personal information, or the institution who authorized access
                  by the student to Respondus Monitor Services) unless
                  specifically required by Institution. For example, if
                  Institution uses third parties to manage student personal
                  information (e.g., Institution agents), the Institution may
                  direct Respondus to share the personal information with that
                  third party under the Institution's direction and control.

                  If, in the future, Respondus, or substantially all of its

                  information or data (including any recordings) may be
                  transferred to the acquiring party, provided that the
                  acquiring party implement a privacy and security policy at

                    Institutions have the ability to retain the data for up to
                    an additional four (4) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

                    the processing is complete. Respondus does not claim
                    ownership in the information or data Institution or any
                    students provide; however, by providing information or data

                    fully paid-up, perpetual license to use, store, modify,
                    copy, and transmit any such information or data for the

                    by posting the new version of these Terms within the
                    Respondus Monitor Software. Respondus also reserves the
                    right to terminate Respondus Monitor at any time after the
                    end of your current license, without notice; however, if
                    your license is a free license, Respondus reserves the right
                    to terminate your license at any time without notice. If
                    your Institution terminates use of Respondus Monitor during
                    your current license, such that you no longer require use of

                  totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines

                  <strong>Arbitrator Powers.</strong>&nbsp;The arbitrator, and

                  exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the

                  this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any
                  claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is
                  void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and

                  not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
                  other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority
                  to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or
                  dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award

                  relief available to an individual under applicable law, the

                  issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
                  essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                  based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
                  arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                  individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
                  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding on you and
                  Respondus.

                  Respondus collects data to operate effectively and to strive
                  to provide you with the best experience with LockDown Browser
                  and Respondus Monitor. You provide some of this data directly,
                  such as when you contact us for support. Some data is obtained
                  by recording how you interact with LockDown Browser and
                  Respondus Monitor by, for example, receiving error reports or
                  usage data from software running on your device. The data we
                  collect depends on the features you use within the Help
                  Services, and includes the following:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  <strong>Webcam &amp; Microphone Check.</strong>&nbsp;The
                  webcam and microphone check streams video and audio from your
                  webcam to the Respondus servers. The video and audio can then
                  be played back by you to ensure the webcam and microphone are
                  working properly. The video and audio recorded during the
                  webcam and microphone check is stored in temporary cache on
                  the Respondus server and is automatically deleted in about an
                  hour. Persistent storage is not used for these recordings, and
                  Respondus does not provide a way to electronically identify
                  the recordings as being transmitted from a specific user.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  <strong>System Check.</strong>&nbsp;The System Check gathers
                  certain information from your computing device, the networking
                  environment, the institution's Learning Management System, and
                  the Respondus Monitor server itself.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  All data gathered during the System Check is presented to you
                  on your screen, including a unique System Check ID. The System
                  Check does NOT contain username, user ID, or the password used
                  to access the institution's Learning Management System.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  You have the option to send System Check results by email, and
                  if so, you must enter an email address for the recipient of
                  the email message. If the System Check results are sent by
                  email, log files from software of LockDown Browser are
                  additionally transmitted to a Respondus server. Log files
                  contain details of the interaction between the LockDown
                  Browser and/or Respondus Monitor and your institution's
                  Learning Management System, from the time you log into the
                  Learning Management System using LockDown Browser and
                  Respondus Monitor until the session is exited or terminated.
                  Log files are stored locally on your computer in an encrypted
                  format and, if transmitted to Respondus, are sent in encrypted
                  format over HTTPS. Log files do NOT contain user name, user
                  ID, or the password used to access the institution's Learning
                  Management System.

                  System Check data and log files may be sent to a Respondus web
                  server or a third party cloud server for storage and further
                  processing by Respondus. Respondus may use System Check data
                  and log files to assist you with a technical issue. Respondus
                  may also aggregate and analyze the System Check data to, for
                  example, improve the Software or its technical support
                  services. System Check data and log files aren't sold,
                  distributed, or made available to affiliate or third party
                  businesses. Report An Issue. The Report An Issue feature
                  enables you to provide feedback to Respondus about LockDown
                  Browser and Respondus Monitor. System Check data and log
                  files, as described above, are collected by Respondus during
                  this process. You are informed of this transfer of data each
                  time the Report An Issue feature is used. You may choose, but
                  you are not required, to provide an email address and contact
                  information when using this feature. System Check data, log
                  files, contact information, and feedback you provide may be
                  sent to a Respondus web server or third party cloud server for
                  storage and further processing by Respondus. No data
                  transmitted to Respondus from the Report An Issue feature will
                  be sold, distributed, or made available to affiliate or third
